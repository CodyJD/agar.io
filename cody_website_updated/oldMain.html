    The main game area consists of scattered non-controled dots your character can collect.<br>
    These dots will invlolve a collision detection and once collected need to be despawned <br>
    and respawned elsewhere on the map. There is going to be multiple players that can <br>
    overtake eachother. The idea is to grow as big as possible. your movement speed starts <br>
    to slow as you get bigger<br>

    The game has a scoring system based on the ammount of objects absorbed into your ball<br>
    The more objects and thus the bigger you are the higher your score. Here is listed the<br>
    the top people in the current server. The end game screen lists your stats including<br>
    factors like objects collected, mass, and the time spent.<br>
