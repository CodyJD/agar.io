    Attack on Typing<br>
    ~Angela & Cody~

		 So for this update we are chaning the scope of our project and stripping down to what<br>
		 parts we think are inportant. We are going to focus on the internet connection aspect of<br>
		 our game and the connection programming and do so in C++. Our strech goal, so to speak, will<br>
     be to get this connection working and adapt that code to X11 and OpenGL to do a type attack<br>
     game where users will have to type words as they show up on screen and be scored based on<br>
     position and speed of typing and errors... etc...<br>
